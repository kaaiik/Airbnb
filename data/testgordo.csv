Next to traveling i like to cook, wander around, take photo's, catching a good film, host or attend dinnerparty's. 

What i love about airbnb is the experience of seeing and feeling the city/village as a local. Therefore i'd like to give fellowtravelers something back.

My name is Joris, and I live in the beautiful city center of Amsterdam. 

Since November 2017 I rent out the Attic of my house to families & friends that are visiting Amsterdam. It is a bit a bohemian place, and though the stairs are considered quite steep, once the guests reach the 3th floor they can enjoy a cozy, warm & colorful private room in the 400-yr old house. Ofcourse during the stay of my guests I'll make sure everything will be as comfortable and convenient as possible.

If you have any questions or special requests, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Warm regards and maybe until soon,

Born and raised in Amsterdam,  traveling the States for work for the last couple of years.

This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I have always been fascinated by storytelling and political campaigning and managed to make a living out of that fascination. I used to work in political campaigning but switched to journalism in 2016. As a free lancer, I travel the United States a lot and touch base in Amsterdam about 6 months a year. 

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. In 2016, I started surfing and have taken every chance ever since to catch waves.  

I started booking with airbnb in 2011  and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place  decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world in 2014. I really do believe the sharing experience adds to the any stay, anywhere. My home is not a holiday rental - I care to share it with travelers who enjoy the sharing and local kind of travel and treat a home that same way.

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

We have 3 boys, in the age of 8,6 and the little one is 2 years old.

In 2013 we bought the boat "" The Calidris"". The main reason to live on a boat was to stay in the city, but still had enough space and above all, freedom. It feels like a little community in this street, because the boat people hang out together, help eachother and know eachother well.

We are very happy to live in such a special place in Amsterdam, enough space, nice views, but still connected to the city! We like cooking together, traveling with our 3 boys, designing our home or making trips with our camper.

In 2014 we started our B&B. Where you sleep now, it used to be the captain's cabin. We immediately removed the stairs, so we do not miss the space at all. It as always a dream for me to run a little boutique hotel. Nowadays we don't run a hotel, but a pittoresque B&B, which we really enjoy. It is fun to meet people all over the world who mostly have a great time at our boat. When you would like to see how houseboat-people live just knock on the door and we will show you around!

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

We will try to answer you as best as we can to make your stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible.

Our ship was build in 1899 and originally used for transportation. Many years ago it was transformed into a beautiful houseboat and now located in the centre of Amsterdam. The Haarlemmerstraat, which was called the best shopping street in The Netherlands in 2012, is 300 meters away. Central Station is within walking distance.
Our ship is docked in the oldest part of Amsterdam: Prinseneiland / Jordaan. 
We have a quay, next to the ship, where you can relax in the sun, till late in the evening. We also have a fire pit at the quay, so you can extend those lovely nights....

We have a big kitchen, with dishwasher, microwave, freezer, etc.
The livingroom is big as well, we have a television, wifi, WII and a wood stove.
In the front of the ship is one (large) bedroom with a bed for two persons and in the back of the ship is also a bed for two persons, a little bit bigger than the other bed.
We have a bathroom with a bathtub and shower.
Washing machine is also available on the ship.
We have two cats. They are both lovely and will stay on the ship.

We have a natural fence of plants around the water, so it is quite safe for little kids. But we also have life vests for the little ones, which is advised.

The ship is docked and not able to sail anymore, so you don't have to be afraid of waking up in the middle of the canal ;)

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria or Italy.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Oud-Noord,52.38976,4.91841,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1.0,1,1125,99.0,99.0,t,20,259,2021-12-06,20,2,2019-08-24,2019-10-22,4.45,4.7,4.75,4.5,4.45,4.35,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already.

I'm Micha from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

After having had 1 year off, I start working again in Amsterdam.

I left my city & job to be able to study Spanish & travel through Middle and South America. I stayed at several Airbnb places and  enjoyed it big time! Nice locations, clean and proper rooms with especially very friendly local hosts!
Now my own apartment is ready too (just recently moved),  I'll definitely list it too.

The combination of a open and friendly culture, beautiful environments and nice people are the perfect combination to me when traveling.

In general: I like to travel, as we all do ;)
For the rest: cooking
sports: kite-surf, ice-skating (the Dutch way) & running in the Amsterdam parks, skiing, swimming & driving my motorcycle
And last but not least exploring nightlife.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Zuid,52.35184,4.85199,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1.0,1,1125,99.0,99.0,t,27,272,2021-12-06,36,3,2019-04-17,2020-02-20,4.78,4.86,4.89,4.89,4.78,4.53,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0

Great that you are having a look at my personal profile. 

In short something about myself; I work and live in Amsterdam since 2009. During work days I have to go right through the city center on my bike to get from “de Pijp”  (the area I live) to the office next to Central Station. It entertains me to see all the people with their own goals, planning of the day and personal expressions. In Amsterdam you never get bored with all the entertainment / shopping area’s, musea, and great terraces with the canal sceneries on the background.

In addition, the city allows me to variate on the restaurants I like to go to, to meet up with friends and relax in its surrounding nature.  As I like to exercise 3 to 4 times a week it is great  to have the Sarphati park next door and greater green areas just outside the city center. 

Conclusion, I thoroughly enjoy living in Amsterdam and would highly recommend it for both business and/ or pleasure.

In between jobs I backbacked through Asia, Central and South America for 1 year, so you can imagine my interest for travelling! I have experienced the most amazing things in which people always made the difference. In that perspective my long time friends describe me (yes I've asked!) as an adventurous, social, sincere, funny, energetic guy that loves good wine and good food in good company. 

After renting out my apartment for a few years I can honestly say that I enjoy hosting people and advising them on what to do while they are here. Since this is my personal home, it's always my goal to achieve a certain connection with every guest in order to trust them with my property.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Centrum-Oost,52.36712,4.90697,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1.0,1,1125,99.0,99.0,t,13,244,2021-12-06,6,1,2019-10-20,2019-12-07,5.0,5.0,4.83,5.0,5.0,4.67,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0

In my humble opinion I am very privileged to live in one of the most special places in the world: Durgerdam (Amsterdam - North).  On a historical dyke (former fisherman village), next to the IJsselmeer lake, in the typical Dutch rural landscape, but still very close to the unique city of Amsterdam.

As television producer I did (and do)  travel  a lot and I am always a fan of remarkable, unique accommodations to sleep and to stay in. Especially  excited do I get  when they are placed in the middle of nature or at unique locations.  Inspired by my visits to those spots, I decided to build my own little house, with all the comfort you need on a special place; my hometown Durgerdam/Amsterdam North.

Together with an architect we created the Tiny House. An authentic small wouden house, where I hope a lot of other people feel at home and can enjoy the green area & of course Amsterdam..

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/492cddd8-35c4-4487-b80f-bea281ca3d7f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hoofddorppleinbuurt,20,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Westerpark,52.37883,4.873,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1.0,1,1125,99.0,99.0,t,19,263,2021-12-06,17,0,2019-08-04,2020-03-06,4.88,5.0,4.82,5.0,4.94,4.82,Exempt,t,20,4,0,0

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

I'll try to describe myself to you starting with the most important thing in my life: my family. It consists of my husband and baby daughter. I really enjoy the free time that we spent together.
Besides my free time I also enjoy my work a lot. I teach dance. I find it very inspiring to teach classes where people can feel save and let go of their worries using dance. 
An important part of my life is conscious consuming. I try to use as few animal products as possible and produce as little garbage as possible.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

We live in the centre of the Netherlands where you are close too city's like Utrecht, Amsterdam and Amersfoort and in the middle of the woods close to lakes and dunes. Hiking, mountenbike and race tracks are very close.

Welcome on our page! We are in love with our home and would like to share it with you when we are away for business or holiday. 

I am a entrepeneur and boat lover.

For us, the houseboat is one big adventure! We jumped into it and we are 99% finished on how we would like to have it. However, as some of you boat lovers will know, a boat is never finished! You will always need to upgrade something or when you are less fortunate, repair something. 

BUT 99% of our stay at home we feel like we are on holiday! For example when:
- we shower in bright sunlight or underneath the stars! 
- we feed the swans from our own dining table
- we enjoy our privacy with no one being able to watch you
- we are treated with the brightest sunrise or a colorful sunset!
- we snuggle into our very very comfortable extra large box spring 
- when we jump into the water from our own boat!
- shall I go on? :)

Please share our love for water & respect our way of living: being humble and respectful towards nature and the people around you. And we welcome you to our HIDDEN GEM in Amsterdam! 

Any questions? We are happy to answer you! 

See you soon?

I came to his city in 1982 and probably will never leave anymore. I love my city, my house, my family, my friends and many other things. Really Amsterdam, ‘ the biggest village on earth’, offers so many beautiful things. We love to bike down town for coffee, shopping at the organic Noord Market or the so called Nine Streets, strolling in the Vondelpark, going to Paradiso or theatre with our daughters.  Many times we feel like tourists in our own town! 
I was educated as teacher French and Dutch but switched to the fashion industry as there was not enough work in teaching at that time. As a fashion agent I sell woman clothes to shops. As my business becomes more difficult the last year I decided to start b&b, and I love it. 
I also love to go hiking in the Alps or reading my books in our beach hut  at half an hour from where we live. 
I love going to cinema especially documentaries and art house films, and: yoga, meeting family and friends.

If you stay with us, there is a big chance that you meet my partner Karel as well. His work is project manager for art in public space. He is even a more enthousiatic mountaineer as I am: he also loves to climb the rocks as well. And when I am reading my book he is a probably out for sailing on the sea in his Laser. 
 
My two daughters can give you the best advices where to spend your money with shopping. They are working hard at school and dreaming and saving money for their round-the-world-trip within a few years.

It as always a dream for me to run a little boutique hotel. Nowadays we don't run a hotel, but a pittoresque B&B, which we really enjoy.

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

I am Henriette, living in Amsterdam since 1983 on several places.
I was born in Eindhoven, in the South of Holland and studied at the University of Nijmegen and Amsterdam, political science and film-science.

Many years I worked as a film/video/performance programmer in theatres. 
Since 1990 I am working as a TV journalist and now for many years for a current affairs program. 

I love my work. And I really enjoy going to arthouse movies, experimental cinema, music and dance.  
Traveling and seeing other cultures makes me happy, as well as meeting my family, eating with friends and biking with my partner.

I already have a B&B since 1999.  I like it so much : it enriches my life meeting all kinds of different people.

Also like decoration and making my house  nice and cozy.

I grew up in Amsterdam but never had the opportunity to stay or even visit a houseboat. I stayed here for 10 days at the end of April and was very fortunate to be blessed with great weather. My stay was excellent and the houseboat contributed a large part to that. It is located in one of the best locations of the city: next to the Jordaan and close to the Westermarkt (with Anne Frank house). It is very quiet on the water even though the city is hustling around you. Sitting outside, looking out over the water is a great experience. Weekends the canal is a bit busier with lots of small boats coming through but it create a unique atmosphere that you will not find in any of the hotels. The houseboat itself is unique so it is hard to describe, it is not small, but it does create an intimate atmosphere. I can see it would be great for a romantic stay (even though I stayed alone Lachebekje (zwart-wit)). The layout makes that the sleeping part is separated from the kitchen/living part even though there are no doors between the sections. The bed is excellent, the shower strong and hot, the kitchen fully equipped, lots of books to read and music to play. But most of the time you will be sitting outside enjoying the view of the canal and the sounds of the city. The nights and morning could be a bit chilly but heather worked just fine. I would recommend the houseboat to anyone who would like ta truly unique Amsterdam experience.

What an amazing boat and location! We spent most of our visit sitting on the back deck...and watching the symphony of the city happen around us. The bed was comfy (and I am picky), the fresh flowers were nice. We also enjoyed feeding the momma and daddy ducks with their babies. We will return and we hope the boat is available when we do.

The houseboat was awesome - everything we expected. Fake was a wonderful hosts and the houseboat had everything we needed. We had a small problem with the heat and Fake came over so quickly. It was really a simple button to reset that was all but I hadn't figured it out. The location is fantastic too - really I think best neighborhood in Amsterdam. What a treat to experience Amsterdam this way. I highly recommend it.

El houseboat fue realmente muy confortable , conseguía que te sintieras como en casa y el lugar donde esta situado es simplemente espectacular, cerca de restaurantes, tiendas - se hace hasta un mercado semanal en la zona donde comprar productos de alimentación frescos, bio.....etc Una familia de patos te visita cada día y se mueren por el pan!!!

Es war alles perfekt, die Fotos geben das Boot realistisch wider, Fake war zuverlässig und sehr nett im Kontakt, der Besitzer sehr serviceorientiert und freundlich. Das Bett ist sehr komfortabel, die Ausstattung völlig ausreichend. Die Lage ist wirklich absolut zentral und alles ist fußläufig gut erreichbar. Wir könne die Unterkunft auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und werden wiederkommen, wenn das Boot frei ist.
